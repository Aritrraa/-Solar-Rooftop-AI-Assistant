## üöÄ Project Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 or newer
- `pip` package manager installed

### Installation Steps

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/solar-rooftop-analyzer.git
cd solar-rooftop-analyzer

# 2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Documentation

### Overview

The Solar Rooftop Analyzer simulates analyzing a rooftop image to estimate solar panel installation metrics.

### Main Components

1. **`analyze_image.py`**  
   Contains `analyze_image(image)` which:  
   - Simulates usable rooftop area (random between 20 and 80 m¬≤).  
   - Calls utility functions to calculate:  
     - Number of solar panels.  
     - Installed kW.  
     - Annual energy output (kWh).  
     - Estimated installation cost.  
     - Savings per year.  
     - ROI period in years.  
   - Returns a dictionary with all values and their units.

2. **`utils.py`**  
   Contains helper functions:  
   - `calculate_num_panels(area_m2)` ‚Äî Calculates how many panels fit into the area.  
   - `calculate_kw_installed(num_panels)` ‚Äî Calculates total installed power in kW.  
   - `calculate_annual_output(kw)` ‚Äî Estimates yearly energy production in kWh.  
   - `calculate_cost(kw)` ‚Äî Estimates installation cost in USD.  
   - `calculate_savings(kWh)` ‚Äî Calculates yearly savings based on production.  
   - `calculate_roi_years(cost, savings)` ‚Äî Returns estimated ROI period.

3. **`app.py`**  
   Flask app to upload rooftop images, call `analyze_image`, and display results via HTML templates.

4. **Templates & Static**  
   - `templates/` contains HTML files for the UI.  
   - `static/` for CSS and JS if needed.

### Technology Stack

- Python 3.10+  
- Flask Web Framework  
- Random simulation (placeholder for real image processing)

## üí° Example Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Homeowner Interested in Solar Potential

**Scenario:**  
A homeowner uploads an image of their rooftop to estimate solar energy production and financial benefits.

**Sample Output:**

![Sample Output Screenshot](solarproject1.png)
![Sample Output Screenshot](solarproject2.png)
![Sample Output Screenshot](solarproject3.png)

```json
{
  "usable_area_m2": " 33.93 m¬≤",
  "num_panels": "21 panels",
  "kw_installed": "6.3 kW",
  "annual_output_kwh": "10405.83 kWh",
  "estimated_cost_usd": "$3428.94",
  "savings_per_year_usd": "$1415.29",
  "roi_years": "2.42 years"
}
---

**Interpretation:**  
- The user can install about 21 solar panels.  
- Estimated yearly energy production is ~10405.83 kWh.  
- Installation cost is ~$3428.94  
- Expected savings are $1415.29per year.  
- ROI is estimated at about 9 years.

### Use Case 2: Solar Installer Preliminary Assessment

- Quickly generate estimates for clients.  
- Helps prepare initial quotes and feasibility reports.

## üîÆ Future Improvement Suggestions

### 1. Real Rooftop Detection with AI
- Use computer vision models (e.g., YOLOv8) for rooftop boundary detection in real photos.

### 2. GIS & Mapping Integration
- Integrate Google Maps or OpenStreetMap APIs for accurate rooftop layouts.

### 3. User Customization
- Allow users to input panel size, electricity rates, local incentives, etc.

### 4. Export Reports
- Generate downloadable PDF reports summarizing analysis and financials.

### 5. Environmental Impact
- Add CO‚ÇÇ offset calculations for environmental benefits.

### 6. Multi-language Support
- Internationalize UI for non-English speakers.

### 7. Mobile App Version
- Develop a mobile app for on-the-go analysis.
